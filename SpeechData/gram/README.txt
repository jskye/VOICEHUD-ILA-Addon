This is the folder for ILA Jsgf Grammar files. When using pre-defined grammar

Sphinx-4 and ILA work very accurate but the things you can say are obviously

limited to what you have defined before. Read more about it here:

http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/doc/sphinx4/edu/cmu/sphinx/jsgf/JSGFGrammar.html

Feel free to add new stuff to the grammar files, just make sure that the words

you are using are inside the dictionary (acoustic model/modelXY/dict/...).

note: when you add german words please write ae,ue,oe instead of ä,ü,ö !
