Here you can put the language model files for sphinx-4. To use it

start ILA, go to settings and set the name of the language model file.

After that deactivate the "use grammar" setting and enjoy :-)

You can find language models here:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/cmusphinx/files/Acoustic%20and%20Language%20Models/

note: 

ILA uses a dynamic language model now by default and you have to deactivate it

before. Go to config.properties in \Data and look for "useDynamicLanguageModel=false"
